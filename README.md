Autonomous golf cart planning and simulation built on ROS kinetic 

This repository contains code for an autonomous "taxi system" for the elderly.
It contains code to generate and follow a path given a source and destination.
It contains the code necessary to communicate with the networking team for the user interface
as well as the voice recognition and pose tracking.
